<p id="accounts">In the 1950s Mikes was known for a warm, rich, wispy sound and was able
to vary the colour of his sound, pitch. He was also adept in using a Harmon mute.
In the 1960s Miles began to play more in the upper register. In the 1969, he 
even incorporated the use of electronic instruments in his music.</p>
<h2>Davis the Painter</h2>
  <hr />
<p> <em>Miles' love</em> was not only for music; he is also considered a fine painter.
Inspired by a Milan-based design movement known as <strong>Memphis</strong>, Miles painted 
a series of abstract paintings in 1988.</p>
